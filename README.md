Run `orion.html` located in the `public` directory to visualize a single transaction and nearest relations.

Run `link.html` located in the `public` directory to visualize and link multiple transactions using the memory add (M+) and memory remove (M-) buttons. Clicking (M+) will save the current transaction data to the clients local memory, and will be loaded up with all future transactions queried. You can use the (M+) button multiple times to expand the visualize. Clicking (M-) will remove the saved data from local memory.
